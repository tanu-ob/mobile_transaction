Purpose of these two scripts(mob_emrjob_process.py and mob_emrjob_total.py) is to run an EMR job(based on Map-reduce technology) which adds an extra column to the input data and combines all the output files. Extra column values are "true" or "false" based on certain conditions(whether it is a mobile transaction). Those conditions have been implemented in reducer script.

Before you run the scripts:
 1. Please supply access key and secret key for Amazon S3 and EMR. Update around line# 10-15 in both scripts.
 2. For EMR job, make sure you have following buckets set up with mapper/reducer files uploaded:
       	mapper='s3://dd.etl.emr.com/scripts/mob_mapper.py',
        reducer='s3://dd.etl.emr.com/scripts/mob_reducer.py',
        input='s3://dd.etl.emr.com/temp/',
        output='s3://dd.etl.emr.com/out_temp/'
    	log_uri='s3://dd.etl.emr.com/logs/log'

 3. For combined job, make sure you have following buckets set up with mapper/reducer files uploaded:
         mapper='s3://dd.etl.emr.com/scripts/mob_mapper_total.py',
         reducer='s3://dd.etl.emr.com/scripts/mob_reducer_total.py',
         output='s3://dd.etl.emr.com/grand_total/total/')
	 log_uri='s3://dd.etl.emr.com/logs/log'


To run EMR job which adds extra column to input data, run following command:
   python mob_emrjob_process.py


To combine all output files in one file, run following command:
   python mob_emrjob_total.py
